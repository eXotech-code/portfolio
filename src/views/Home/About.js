                        I am a software developer based in Poland.
                        Obsessed with technology both old and new
                        I get inspiration from it to create smart
                        and easy to use tools. I like solving problems
                        and believe that collaborating in a team
                        or contributing to open source projects make
                        for great opportunities to learn good software
                        development practices.
                    </p>
                    <p className="about-section-paragraph">
                        I try to contribute to open source projects
                        whenever I can. As Iâ€™m still learning about
                        programming I feel that it teaches me how
                        to make great software professionally.
                        You can find me on GitHub and see what am I
                        currently working on.
